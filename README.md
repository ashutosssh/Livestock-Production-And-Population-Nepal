# 🐄 Livestock Production and Population in Nepal

## 📊 Overview

This project presents a data-driven analysis of **livestock production**, **livestock population**, and **agricultural output** in Nepal. It also includes the development of a **predictive machine learning model** aimed at forecasting milk production levels.

The analysis was conducted using Python and popular data science libraries, with a focus on clear visual representation of trends and patterns across commodities and years.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the trends in livestock production (meat, milk, eggs, etc.)
- Examine the population trends of various livestock animals.
- Study agricultural crop production patterns related to livestock needs.
- Visualize year-wise and commodity-wise patterns using effective graphs.
- Build and evaluate a classification model to predict milk production levels.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  

---

## 📁 Files

- `Livestock_Production_Analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook for analysis, visualization & ML model
- `Livestock.csv` – Dataset containing production and population records *(if included)*
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## 📉 Visualizations Included

- Line plots and bar charts for time-series trends
- Category-wise comparisons of livestock production
- Heatmaps and correlation matrices (if applicable)
- Charts comparing population vs. production for selected commodities

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Component

A **classification model** was developed using Scikit-Learn to:

- Predict levels of milk production based on livestock and crop features.
- Compare performance of multiple algorithms.
- Evaluate results using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.

---

## ✅ Results

- Revealed trends and imbalances in livestock production and population growth.
- Visualized high- and low-performing commodities across different years.
- Built a basic predictive model to support production planning.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Use more granular or recent datasets (e.g., district-wise or farm-level).
- Integrate external features like weather or market price data.
- Develop an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Dash**.
